      <h2>SI 330</h2>
      <p>My main goal in this course is to help you get started with your own data harvesting, processing, and aggregation. Data analysis is crucial to evaluating and designing solutions and applications, as well as understanding users' information needs and how they may want to use it. In many cases, the data we need to access is distributed online among many Web pages, stored in a database, or available in a large text file. Often these data (e.g., Web server logs) are too large to obtain and/or process manually. Instead, we need an automated way to gather the data, parse it, and summarize it before we can do more advanced analysis. In this course, you will have the opportunity to learn to use Python and its modules to accomplish these tasks in a quick and easy, yet useful and repeatable, way.</p>
